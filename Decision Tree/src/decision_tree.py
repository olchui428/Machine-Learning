        Tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm

        A decision tree is a machine learning model that fits data with a tree
        structure. Each branching point along the tree marks a decision (e.g.
        today is sunny or today is not sunny). Data is filtered by the value of
        each attribute to the next level of the tree. At the next level, the process
        starts again with the remaining attributes, recursing on the filtered data.

        Which attributes to split on at each point in the tree are decided by the
        information gain of a specific attribute.

        Here, you will implement a binary decision tree that uses the ID3 algorithm.
        Your decision tree will be contained in `self.tree`, which consists of

    TODO: Implement me!

    Information gain is how a decision tree makes decisions on how to create
    split points in the tree. Information gain is measured in terms of entropy.
    The goal of a decision tree is to decrease entropy at each split point as much as
    possible. This function should work perfectly or your decision tree will not work
    properly.

    Information gain is a central concept in many machine learning algorithms. In
    decision trees, it captures how effective splitting the tree on a specific attribute
    will be for the goal of classifying the training data correctly. Consider
    data points S and an attribute A. S is split into two data points given binary A:

        S(A == 0) and S(A == 1)

    Together, the two subsets make up S. If A was an attribute perfectly correlated with
    the class of each data point in S, then all points in a given subset will have the
    same class. Clearly, in this case, we want something that captures that A is a good
    attribute to use in the decision tree. This something is information gain. Formally:

        IG(S,A) = H(S) - H(S|A)

    where H is information entropy. Recall that entropy captures how orderly or chaotic
    a system is. A system that is very chaotic will evenly distribute probabilities to
    all outcomes (e.g. 50% chance of class 0, 50% chance of class 1). Machine learning
    algorithms work to decrease entropy, as that is the only way to make predictions
    that are accurate on testing data. Formally, H is defined as:

        H(S) = sum_{c in (classes in S)} -p(c) * log_2 p(c)

    To elaborate: for each class in S, you compute its prior probability p(c):

        (# of elements of class c in S) / (total # of elements in S)

    Then you compute the term for this class:

        -p(c) * log_2 p(c)

    Then compute the sum across all classes. The final number is the entropy. To gain
    more intution about entropy, consider the following - what does H(S) = 0 tell you
    about S?

    Information gain is an extension of entropy. The equation for information gain
    involves comparing the entropy of the set and the entropy of the set when conditioned
    on selecting for a single attribute (e.g. S(A == 0)).
